# Quartus-School-Projects

## Brief Description on the Repository

This repository consists of VHDL based projects that were done during my undergraduate studies for a subject called Programmable Electronics Design.
The main tool used for developing was Quartus and projects executed on the Altera DE2 board.
It consists of several basic projects that introduce the following concepts:
* Sequential and Concurrent Logic
* Conditional and Loop Statements
* Prototyping
* Test benches
* Behavioral Modelling
* State Machines

## About the Main Project

The traffic-one project puts into use all these concepts and was the main examinable project for the subject.
The project implements a traffic light system betweeen a main and secondary road. 
An ultrasonic sensor is interfaced. The sensor detect if a car is present or is approaching from the secondary road torwards the intersection.
If one approaches the system sets off a 15 seconds timer that will allow secondary road users to get access to get into the main road for the following 45-60 seconds.
The aim of the system is to allow the main road users to have full access to the road and only consider the secondary road when there are actually vehicles approaching
