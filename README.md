# Quartus-School-Projects

## Brief Description

This repository consists of projects that were done during my undergraduate studies for a subject called Programmable Electronics Design.
The main tool used for developing was Quartus and projects executed on the Altera DE2 board.
It consists of several basic projects that introduce the following concepts:
* Sequential and Concurrent Logic
* Conditional and Loop Statements
* Prototyping
* Test benches
* Behavioral Modelling
* State Machines

The traffic-one project puts into use all these concepts and was the main examinable project for the subject.
